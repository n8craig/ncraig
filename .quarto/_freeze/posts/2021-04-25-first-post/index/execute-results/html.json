While I've written a [couple](https://www.zotero.org/ncraig/) of quantitative papers in the past, I generally relied on GUI based statistical tools like Excel, JMP, or the very nice [PAST](https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/research/infrastructure/past/) application. They were ok, but really felt lacking, particularly in terms of laying out plots or documenting work flows. Recently, after a brief sojourn with python and jupyter notebooks, I became interested in learning R as a platform for working with data, generating reproducible results, and communicating them effectively on the internet. While python is a great language, in many ways R and R Markdown seem better suited to my personal needs.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A common GUI based research organization.](https://i.imgur.com/Z0Uaacs.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSome time ago, I began shifting my writing from Microsoft Word to Markdown, using [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) or [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and combining these with [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), the [Better BibTex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) plugin, and [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). Given a writing workflow that entails Markdown-Zotero and an interest in quantitative themes, R and R Markdown seemed like logical tools to explore. I looked at several of the R Markdown platforms like [Rpubs](https://rpubs.com/ncraig) as well as packages like `bookdown` and `blogdown`. After examining the field, the [`distill`](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) package seemed like a full fledged technical writing tool without some of the hassles that people reported using blogdown/go. So I figured I'd give `distill` a try. This website was borne out of that process.\n\nAn emerging sprout, just starting to grow (see @fig-popalo).
