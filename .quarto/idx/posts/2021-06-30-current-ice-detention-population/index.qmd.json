On Friday March 13, 2020 ICE suspended family and social visitation. On March 27, 2020 ICE [established](https://web.archive.org/web/20200327175825/https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus) the Guidance on COVID-19 web page and indicated the site would be updated frequently. Shortly afterwards I began logging the data on a daily basis, occasionally relying on the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine's [regular scrapes](https://web.archive.org/web/20200401000000*/https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus) of the page to pick up days that I missed. Results of those scrapes are contained in a [github](https://github.com/n8craig/ICE-COVID-19) repository and key data including the total detained population (@fig-ice-detention-current), number of active COVID-19 cases in detention (@fig-total-confirmed-covid-19), cumulative COVID-19 cases (@fig-cumulative-covid-19), and total number of COVID-19 tests (@fig-total-covid-19-tests).\n\n```{r load-libraries}\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\noptions(digits=3)\nopts_chunk$set(results = 'asis',\n               comment = NA,\n               prompt = FALSE,\n               cache = FALSE)\n\n# Turn off scientific notation\noptions(digits=5, scipen=15)\n```\n\n```{r load-dataset}\n# Load Dataset\ndf_summary <- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n8craig/ICE-COVID-19/main/data/covid_summaries.csv\", \n    col_types = cols(Date = col_date(format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"), \n        `Total Deaths` = col_double(), `Total COVID-19 Confirmed in Custody` = col_double())) %>% \n  clean_names()\n```\n\n# Current Total Detained Population\n\n```{r}\nb_inaug <- df_summary %>% \n  filter(date == \"2021-01-20\") %>% \n  pluck(\"total_detained\")\n\nlowest <- df_summary %>% \n  filter(date == \"2021-03-09\") %>% \n  pluck(\"total_detained\")\n\nyesterday <- df_summary %>% \n  filter(date == Sys.Date()-1) %>% \n  pluck(\"total_detained\")\n\ndifference <- yesterday-lowest\n\ndetention_change <- yesterday - lowest\n\npercent_change <- round((difference/lowest)*100,0)\n\n```\n\nWhen President Biden took office, the detained population was `r b_inaug`. The lowest detention population was `r lowest` which was reported by ICE between March 9-15, 2021. This was just under three months into the Biden administration. However, by March 16 the detained population began rising again. As of `r format(Sys.Date(), \"%B %e, %Y\")`, the detained population is `r yesterday` which represents an increase of `r detention_change` detained individuals from the lowest point and a `r percent_change`% change from that value.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-ice-detention-current\n#| fig-cap: \"ICE detention population plotted over time.

By early April 2021, as detention numbers started to rise, the number of active COVID-19 cases in detention shot up quickly. On May 21, 2021 at 2123 active cases was the highest level since the start of the pandemic. While active cases began to fall by May 25, @fig-total-confirmed-covid-19 shows that the number of active cases remains more than double its lowest point.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-total-confirmed-covid-19\n#| fig-cap: \"Total number of active COVID-19 cases plotted over time.

The rate of increase dipped slightly around March but quickly shot up in April and remains growing rapidly.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-cumulative-covid-19\n#| fig-cap: \"Cumulative COVID-19 cases in ICE detention plotted over time.

Based on data reported by ICE, the Biden administration does not appear to have accelerated the rate of COVID-19 testing in ICE detention.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-total-covid-19-tests\n#| fig-cap: \"Cumulative number of COVID-19 tests plotted over time.
