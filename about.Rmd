I am an anthropologist and archaeologist interested in the study of power. I am currently looking at incarceration and immigration. My thinking is informed by such ideas as Foucault's biopower, Agamben's state of exception, and Mbembe's necropolitics. I also like to count things, and sometimes make maps.
