# Introduction

An emerging sprout, just starting to grow (see Figure \@ref(fig:popalo)). Hopefully treatments will produce positive results (Figure \@ref(fig:plant-growth)).

```{r popalo, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Popaloquelite (*Porophyllum ruderale*) sprout."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/popalo-sprout.jpg")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggstatsplot)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
PlantGrowth
```

```{r plant-growth, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Plant growth dataset, comparing yields (measured by dry weights) obtained under a control and two different treatment conditions. Data source Dobson (1983)"}
PlantGrowth %>% 

  ggbetweenstats(.,x=group, y = weight)
```
