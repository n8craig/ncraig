  This second post contains a single plot of the cars dataset.
  It shows the relationship between the variables wt and mpg.
  Not very exciting, but a start.

This is a second post. Below is a bivariate scatterplot of the cars dataset showing the relationship between weight (wt) and miles per gallon (mpg). A modest start, but something to consider.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= mpg, y=wt))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()
```
