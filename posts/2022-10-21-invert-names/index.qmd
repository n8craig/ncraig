Occasionally, we get data frames where items are comma separated and reverse order. Perhaps the most common case is where first and last names are reversed and comma separated. Another, situation is when applying controlled vocabularies, which are often structured in this way (@fig-pp). Let's run through switching the terms and see the result (#tbl-result).

```{r message=FALSE}
# Load libraries
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

```{r}
# Create data
df <- data.frame (name_inverse  = c("Henry, John", 
                      "Bunyan, Paul")
                  )
```

```{r tbl-result}
#| tbl-cap: Results showing the reversal of names. Note the extra columns can be removed with `select`.
df <- df |> separate(name_inverse, c("last", "first"),
               remove = FALSE) |> 
  mutate(name = paste(first, last, sep = " "), 
         .before = name_inverse)
df
```
