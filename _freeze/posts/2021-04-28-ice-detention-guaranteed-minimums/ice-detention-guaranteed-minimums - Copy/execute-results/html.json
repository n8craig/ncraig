The data on this page are now updated regularly and may be subject to change in the future. This post examines one snapshot in time. Future posts may attempt to further track changes over time.\n\nIn addition to looking at Guaranteed Minimums, effort is made here to examine the number of empty Guaranteed Minimum beds which, following Selman and Leighton's [-@selman2010, 114] term of \"ghost inmates\" which originates in the private and for-profit corrections incarceration sector, are referred to here as \"Ghost Beds.\" As Selman and Leighton note because private prisons operate and make money on economies of scale, many for-profit private prison contracts contain clauses that facilities must remain 90% full and if they aren't the contracts are structured to guaranteed payment for a minimum number of incarcerated persons. ICE facilities, both publicly and privately run, contain Guaranteed Minimums which are listed in the [FY21 year to date](https://www.ice.gov/detain/detention-management) report.\n\nICE's FY21 year to date report lists each facility's type, Average Daily Population (ADP) and contractual Guaranteed Minimums. Based on ADP and Guaranteed Minimums, it is possible to estimate the number of empty guaranteed beds or Ghost Beds. It is also possible to explore patterns of ADP, Guaranteed Minimums, and Ghost Beds by facility type.\n\n## Summary {#summary}\n\nFor those who may not wish to read through the entire data exploration. A brief summary of some key findings are reported below.\n\nSection 2 data exploration begins by looking at facility types, which appears in ICE's data set as Type Detailed, as well as ADP by Type Detailed. Private facilities are the most common facility type, though arrangements with US Marshals Service (USMS) are also extremely common. It bears mention that USMS contracts with ICE are under studied and extremely problematic [@jameson2020]. Not technically private contracts, they operate on a distinct business model related to procurement. While Service Processing Centers (SPC) have the highest ADP by type, Inter-Governmental Service Agreements (IGSA) and Contract Detention Facilities (CDF) are more numerous.\n\nSection 3 looks at Guaranteed Minimums generally and by Type Detailed. At present, there are 34390 guaranteed beds distributed among 50 facilities. There is a strong correlation between total ADP, termed Total Detained and Guaranteed Minimum, Total Detained population explains 46% of the variation in Guaranteed Minimums. As a type, IGSA's have the largest share of Guaranteed Minimums overall, which is just under 2/3. On average, among facilities with Guaranteed Minimums, IGSA's tend to have larger Guaranteed Minimums and IGSA's are more numerous as a type. However, CDF's, with just under 1/3, also have a large portion of Guaranteed Minimums. IGSA's and CDF's make up 90% of the facilities with Guaranteed Minimums and 92% of the Guaranteed Minimum beds.\n\nSection 4 looks at Ghost Beds generally, by Type Detailed and explores Guaranteed Minimum as well as Ghost Bed costs. The mean Guaranteed Minimum per diem is \\$123.04 (SD=43.02). The total estimated cost of Guaranteed Minimums is \\$4,308,391 per day, \\$129,251,730 per month, or \\$1,572,562,715 per year. At present 2/3 of Guaranteed Minimums are empty Ghost Beds. At the present rate of Ghost Beds, which may change, the total estimated cost is \\$2,952,525 per day, \\$88,575,750 per month, or \\$1,077,671,625 per year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Facility Types {#sec:facility-types}\n\nThe [FY21 year to date](https://www.ice.gov/detain/detention-management) report lists 142 facilities, five of which are not located on the continental US. ICE lists six kinds of facilities:\n\n-   Bureau of Prisons (BOP) are public facilities.\n-   Contract Detention Facilities (CDF), these are private facilities generally owned by a private prison company.\n-   Intergovernmental Service Agreement (IGSA), these are privately managed facilities owned by a county or municipality whose management is subcontracted to a private prison company.\n-   Service Processing Centers (SPC), are public facilities managed by ICE though often the security staff are subcontracted to a private company.\n-   US Marshals Service Intergovernmental Agreement (USMS IGA) are established US Marshals contracts with local jails that are used by ICE for immigration detention purposes. USMS IGA's may be a mix of public and private facilities depending on whether local governments subcontract out jail management to a private contractor.\n-   Other\n\n<aside>\n\nThe five ICE detention facilities located outside of the continental US are:\n\n-   Honolulu Federal Detention Center, HI\n-   Hiland Mountain Correctional Center, AK\n-   Guaynabo MDC PR\n-   Department Of Corrections GU\n-   Saipan Department Of Corrections MP\n\n</aside>\n\n## Facility Counts by Facility Type {#facility-counts-by-facility-type}\n\nTable \\@ref(tab:facility-types) and Figure \\@ref(fig:facility-types-bar-plot) show that by count the most common type of facility are IGSA's (n=73) followed by USMS IGAs (n=39), and CDF (n=17). IGSA's andCDF's are private and USMS IGA's may be a mix of public and private local jails (see list above). Regardless, between IGSA's and CDF's 63% (n=90) of ICE detention facilities by count are unambiguously privately managed. USMS IGA's still operate more as \"procurement not policy\" in what is an \"opaque and intricate business practice\" [@jameson2020: 283] in which local counties and municipalities view detention as a key source of income [@jameson2020: 2839].\n\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Map of ICE detention facilities.](ice-detention-guaranteed-minimums---Copy_files/figure-html/map-all-facilities-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n<caption>Count and Percent Total Facilities by Type.</caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Type Detailed </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> n </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> % Total Facilities </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> BOP </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.41 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> SPC </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3.52 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Other </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 6 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4.23 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> CDF </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 17 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 11.97 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> USMS IGA </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 39 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 27.46 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> IGSA </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 73 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 51.41 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bar chart of ICE detention facilities by facility type.](ice-detention-guaranteed-minimums---Copy_files/figure-html/facility-types-bar-plot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n\nFigure \\@ref(fig:facility-map-facet-by-type) shows were ICE detention facilities are located based on facility type.

Examining total ADP by facility type shows that IGSA's (n=8999) and CDF's (n=3567), which are both private kinds of facilities, make up 81% (n=12566) of the total ADP (see Table \\@ref(tab:adp-by-facility-type-table). However, IGSA's (n=73) and CDF's (n=17) make up 63% of the total number of facilities. They hold a larger portion of the total ADP because these kinds of facilities are generally larger, though at present SPC's appear to have a higher mean ADP though there are few of this kind of facility (n=5).\n\n\n\n```\nJoining, by = \"type_detailed\"\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n<caption>Summary statistics of ADP by ICE detention facility type.</caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Type Detailed </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> n </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> % Total Facilities </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Total ADP </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Mean ADP </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> SD ADP </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> % Total ADP </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> BOP </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.41 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 20 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 10.00 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 9.90 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.13 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> CDF </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 17 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 11.97 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3567 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 209.82 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 188.57 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 22.96 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> IGSA </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 73 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 51.41 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 8999 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 123.27 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 139.88 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 57.93 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Other </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 6 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4.23 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 177 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 29.50 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 48.88 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.14 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> SPC </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3.52 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1349 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 269.80 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 121.26 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 8.68 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> USMS IGA </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 39 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 27.46 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1423 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 36.49 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 45.43 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 9.16 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n\n\nLooking at the distribution of ADP by ICE detention facility type, one can see that SPC's have the highest mean ADP (M=269.80, SD=121.26), while CDF's (M=209.82, SD=188.57) and IGSA's (M=123.27, SD=139.88) have the next highest mean ADP (see Table \\@ref(tab:adp-by-facility-type-table)). A combined violin-sina plot (Figure \\@ref(fig:adp-by-facility-type-figure)) illustrates the distribution of ADP by ICE detention facility type [@hintze1998; @sidiropoulos2018]. So while SPC's presently have larger detained populations on average, IGSA's and CDF's are far more numerous. While USMS IGA's (n= 39) are the second most numerous kind of facility they have a comparatively lower total ADP (n=1423) or by facility average ADP (M=36.49, SD=45.43).\n\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Violin and Sina plot of ADPs by ICE detention facility type.](ice-detention-guaranteed-minimums---Copy_files/figure-html/adp-by-facility-type-figure-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n\n# Guaranteed Minimums {#guaranteed-minimums}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the 142 facilities reported by ICE in the FY21 year to date dataset, 35% (n=50) have contractual guaranteed minimums (Table @ref(tab:guaranteed-min-by-facility)). The Pearson's product-moment correlation between Guaranteed Minimum and Total Detained is positive, statistically significant, and very large ($r = 0.68, t(48) = 6.40, p < .001$). A linear model (estimated using OLS) was applied to predict Guaranteed Minimum with Total Detained. The model explains a statistically significant and substantial proportion of variance ($R^2 = 0.46, F(1, 48) = 40.91, p < .001, adj. R^2 = 0.45$). The effect of Total Detained on Guaranteed Minimums is statistically significant and positive ($b=2.07, t(48) = 6.40, p < .001$). Larger facilities have more guaranteed minimums.\n\n## Guaranteed Minimums by Facility Type {#guaranteed-minimums-by-facility-type}\n\nFacilities with guaranteed minimums are of three types: IGSA's, CDF's, and SPC's (Figure @ref(fig:histogram-guaranteed-min-by-type) and Table @ref(tab:guaranteed-min-by-facility-type)).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout=\"l-body-outset\"}\n:::

SPC's average 528 guaranteed beds per facility which is the lowest of the three types. So SPC's have guaranteed minimums at the highest rate, but they make up a relatively small proportion of the facilities with guaranteed minimums, and a small proportion of the total number of guaranteed beds.\n\nThere are 30 IGSA's that have guaranteed minimums, 41% of this facility type has guaranteed minimums, they constitute 60% of the facilities with guaranteed minimums, which comprises 61.95 of all guaranteed minimum beds. IGSA's average 710.17 guaranteed beds per facility which is the highest of any of the three types. IGSA's constitute the majority of facilities with guaranteed minimums and the majority of guaranteed minimum beds. IGSA's also have the highest per facility guaranteed minimum average. The four facilities with the most number of guaranteed minimum beds are all IGSA's (Table \\@ref(tab:guaranteed-min-by-facility).\n\nThere are 15 CFS that have guaranteed minimums, 88% of this type of facility has guaranteed minimums, they make up 10% of all facilities with guaranteed minimums , which comprises 30% of all guaranteed minimum beds, and as a type averages 696.2 guaranteed beds per facility. Thus, a very high proportion of this facility type has guaranteed minimums, but they make up a relatively small proportion of the total number of facilities with guaranteed minimums. CFS's have average guaranteed minimums that are relatively close to IGSA's.\n\nTogether, CDF's and IGSA's constitute 90% of the facilities with guaranteed minimums and 92% of the guaranteed minimum beds (Figure \\@ref(fig:guaranteed-min-by-facility-type-figure)). The overwhelming number of guaranteed minimums are thus in private facilities.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout=\"l-body-outset\"}\n\n```\nJoining, by = \"type_detailed\"\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n<caption>Guaranteed minimums by facility type.</caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Type Detailed </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> n\nFacilities w.

The DHS budget request for FY21 provides information on 27 facilities with guaranteed minimums [@dhs2020, ICE-O&S-137], and among those facilities (n=27) the mean per diem is \\$123.04 (SD=43.02). Presumably, the Guaranteed Minimums at the remaining 23 facilities were established after the FY21 budget request. For the purpose of estimating the total cost of Guaranteed Minimums and unused Ghost Beds, for the 23 facilities for which Guaranteed Minimums are unlisted the average of the Guaranteed Minimums per diem rate for the 27 facilities listed in the FY21 budget request are used [@dhs2020, ICE-O&S-137].\n\n\n\n```\nRows: 50 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (5): Name, AOR, Type Detailed, Monthly, Reported in FY21 Budget Request\ndbl (1): Guaranteed Minimum Per Diem\nnum (1): Guaranteed Minimum\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n```\nJoining, by = \"name\"\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on reported Guaranteed Minimum per diem rates, and average rates where not reported, the total daily cost of Guaranteed Minimum ICE detention beds is \\$4,308,391 and the total estimated cost of Ghost Beds is \\$2,952,525.\n\nFigure \\@ref(fig:guaranteed-min-per-diem) shows the Guaranteed Minimum per diem rate by facility type. SPC's tend to have higher Guaranteed Minimum per diem costs than either CDF's or IGSA's. One reason that a large number of IGSA's guaranteed minimums hover around a per diem of 125 is that many of these facilities are not listed in the FY21 year to date figures and the values are based on averages. *It would be good to determine which kinds of facilities have new Guaranteed Minimums*. Figure \\@ref(fig:guaranteed-minimum-average-cost-by-facility-type) shows the average Guaranteed Minimum cost by facility type. On average, most facilities have roughly similar costs even though IGSA's and CFS's are larger. The leveling of average cost may be related to the higher per diems for SPC's. Figure \\@ref(fig:ghost-bed-cost-by-facility-type) shows the average Ghost Bed cost by facility type. SPC's have slightly lower costs than IGSA's and CDF's.\n\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Violin-sina plot of Guaranteed Minimum per diem rate by ICE detention Type Detailed.](ice-detention-guaranteed-minimums---Copy_files/figure-html/guaranteed-min-per-diem-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Violin-sina plot of average Guaranteed Minimum Cost by ICE detention Type Detailed.](ice-detention-guaranteed-minimums---Copy_files/figure-html/guaranteed-minimum-average-cost-by-facility-type-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Violin-sina plot of Ghost Bed Cost by ICE detention Type Detailed.](ice-detention-guaranteed-minimums---Copy_files/figure-html/ghost-bed-cost-by-facility-type-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n\n# Supplementary\n\n## Session Information\n\n\nAnalyses were conducted using the R Statistical language (version 4.2.1; R Core\nTeam, 2022) on Windows 10 x64 (build 19044)\n\n\n## Packages\n\nThe following R packages were used used in preparing this document.\n\n\n  - rmarkdown (version 2.18; Allaire J et al., 2022)\n  - ggthemes (version 4.2.4; Arnold J, 2021)\n  - effectsize (version 0.8.2; Ben-Shachar MS et al., 2020)\n  - rio (version 0.5.29; Chan C et al., 2021)\n  - summarytools (version 1.0.1; Comtois D, 2022)\n  - janitor (version 2.1.0; Firke S, 2021)\n  - purrr (version 0.3.5; Henry L, Wickham H, 2022)\n  - parameters (version 0.20.0; Lüdecke D et al., 2020)\n  - performance (version 0.10.1; Lüdecke D et al., 2021)\n  - easystats (version 0.6.0; Lüdecke D et al., 2022)\n  - see (version 0.7.4; Lüdecke D et al., 2021)\n  - insight (version 0.18.8; Lüdecke D et al., 2019)\n  - bayestestR (version 0.13.0; Makowski D et al., 2019)\n  - modelbased (version 0.8.5; Makowski D et al., 2020)\n  - correlation (version 0.8.3; Makowski D et al., 2020)\n  - report (version 0.5.5; Makowski D et al., 2021)\n  - tibble (version 3.1.8; Müller K, Wickham H, 2022)\n  - ggstatsplot (version 0.10.0; Patil I, 2021)\n  - datawizard (version 0.6.4; Patil I et al., 2022)\n  - sf (version 1.0.9; Pebesma E, 2018)\n  - ggforce (version 0.4.1; Pedersen T, 2022)\n  - R (version 4.2.1; R Core Team, 2022)\n  - ggplot2 (version 3.4.0; Wickham H, 2016)\n  - forcats (version 0.5.2; Wickham H, 2022)\n  - stringr (version 1.4.1; Wickham H, 2022)\n  - tidyverse (version 1.3.2; Wickham H et al., 2019)\n  - readxl (version 1.4.1; Wickham H, Bryan J, 2022)\n  - dplyr (version 1.0.10; Wickham H et al., 2022)\n  - tidyr (version 1.2.1; Wickham H, Girlich M, 2022)\n  - readr (version 2.1.3; Wickham H et al., 2022)\n  - knitr (version 1.39; Xie Y, 2022)\n  - kableExtra (version 1.3.4; Zhu H, 2021)\n",
