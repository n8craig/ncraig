The scraped data are maintained in a GitHub [repository](https://github.com/n8craig/ICE-COVID-19). COVID-19 data reported by ICE are linked with geocoded facility locations. COVID-19 data are assembled in \"long\" format, plotted with `ggplot` [@R-ggplot2], and animated with the `gganimate` [@R-gganimate] library.\n\n## Cumulative COVID-19 Map\n\nA map of cumulative COVID-19 cases by ICE detention facility over time.\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.gif)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Cumulative COVID-19 Line Plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.gif)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Total Detained and Active Cases Line Plot Over Time\n\nThe following is a pair of line plots showing detained population and active COVID-19 cases in custody over time. Comparing the plots one can see that between July and January 2020 as the detained population decreased the number of active COVID-19 cases in custody declined. Likewise, one can see that in late March 2021 as the total detained population began to rise the number of active COVID-19 cases in custody also rose and that by April 2021 both the detained population and active COVID-19 cases in ICE detention are rising rapidly.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Active COVID-19 Map\n\nA map of active COVID-19 cases by ICE detention facility over time.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.gif)\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
