While La Palma has the highest number of active cases, it did not have the largest maximum active cases. Adams which experienced a significant spike in active cases is not among those with more than 850 cumulative cases, meaning it is out of the top five, though is remains among the facilities with the highest number of cumulative cases. Similarly, Alexandria Staging Facility experienced a very large spike in active cases early on, it is not among the facilities with the highest number of cumulative cases.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n## Active\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/covid-active-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Cumulative\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/covid-cumulative-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!--# {.unnumbered}\n\n# Facet Plot {.unnumbered}\n\nFacilities are listed in alphabetical order. The figure is best viewed on a desktop computer with the window maximized. It can be interesting look at facilities with large cumulative numbers and examine trends in the current side of the plot. Facilities to look for include: La Palma, Eloy, Karnes Family Residential, and Port Isabel. Each of these have large cumulative numbers, but there are differing patterns in how infections occurred and were counted over time. -->\n```\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/cumulative-facet_36e8aa0ac7416557d95b855c29a4a870'}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/current-facet_a1d50a67c6cd2514eba61f1d26fcfac7'}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell .column-page hash='index_cache/html/combined-facet-plot_1f259c8b65d5e755ae4be43d578c671a'}\n\n:::\n",
