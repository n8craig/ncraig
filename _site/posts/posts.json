As of this writing, the project has more than fourteen different tools. Though not listed among those tools, GDELT also offers the Television Database Explorer and API.\r\nIn May of 2021, I used GDELT to discuss news coverage of Critical Race Theory (CRT). Dr. Leetaru also included Critical Race Theory in two of his brief news summaries:\r\nHow Has Television News Covered Critical Race Theory? From June 6, 2021 in RealClearPolitics\r\nHow Is Critical Race Theory Being Covered On Television News? From November 10, 2021 in RealClearPolitics. I think there is quite a bit more to consider in regards to CRT. However, here I want to discuss some things I learned about retrieval of GDELT data along the way.\r\nApplication programming interfaces are a good way to access data, particularly when they are regularly updated like GDELT. In the past, I used the Television Explorer interface, downloaded a CSV file, and worked with that on my hard drive. While I was grateful for the data, this method involved doing analysis on a static file. I would rather access the API directly, pull in the comma delimited data, and make a data frame for further processing all in R. Moreover, I want that request and data frame output to be able to run at some point again in the future–perhaps even updated programmatically.\r\nI encountered three ways of communicating with the GDELT API. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. The three ways are:\r\nnewsflash::query_tv is the simplest and fastest method and good for a quick check but may produce unexpected results.\r\nreader::read_csv permits finer control over parameters but takes a some setting up. I find this is the preferred method.\r\nhttr and jsonlite will pull the data in JSON format with lots of ancillary information. However, returning the desired product (a CSV table) looks a bit daunting and compared to read_csv involves unnecessary steps. Below I illustrate each of these three methods discussing the strengths and weaknesses I identified with these approaches.\r\nI discuss read_csv() first and at the greatest length because I believe it the best method for retrieving a CSV file for further processing in R.\r\nCSV API request to readr::read_csv()\r\nOne of the GDELT 2.0 TV News API’s six output formats is CSV. When an API request is made with format=csv the browser returns a CSV file. Therefore, a properly constructed GDELT TV News API request URL can be passed directly to read_csv() and the function will create a data frame. However, before doing that I discuss how to construct a request URL using the Explorer GUI and show how to set the output format to CSV.\r\nDetermining the API request parameters\r\nGDELT 2.0 TV News API has a fair number of options; some really must be understood to proceed forward. The Explorer Summary search page is broken into a series of steps. I walk through these and discuss each in turn.\r\nStep 1: Dataset\r\nThe Explorer GUI lets users choose among 5 different data sets:\r\nGlobal Online News Coverage: Online textual news sources along with some images.\r\nTelevision News (Internet Archive): Full text search of complete raw closed captioning stream. Announcement\r\nTelevision News AI (Internet Archive): Searches on visual entities, caption entities, automated speech recognition (ASR), caption keywords, and OCR of onscreen text. Announcement\r\nChyron Explorer (Internet Archive): Search the Internet Archive’s “Third Eye” OCR stream.\r\nChyron Browser: Visual summaries of chyron text overlays for a specified date.\r\nOnce the desired data set is selected, the Explorer GUI refreshes and the search fields change. Though the API request structure is similar across the five data sets, each is slightly different because the data being queried are either from different news sources (written, TV closed captions, TV chyrons) or are the same data sources processed in different ways (TV closed captions vs. AI). Knowing which data set one is working with is a key step to successfully using the Explorer GUI and getting a properly structured request URL. Here I discuss parameters related to the TV News data set.\r\nTo the far right, in the section where it says “Enter Search” there is an blue “i” info button. Clicking this reveals hidden text that explains more about the data structure and how to construct searches. Each parameter has its own info button. Reading these entries carefully and consulting them frequently is useful for grasping the details of the search process. Note that these “i” buttons may not work properly in Firefox. They do work well with Chrome.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Output Type\r\nOne must choose to display results of a single query “Summery Overview Dashboard” or a comparison of multiple queries “Comparison Visualization.” Both types of output are useful and work in similar ways. Here, I discuss single query “Summery Overview Dashboard” results.\r\nStep 3: Enter Search\r\nMany big decisions are made in this section including the search term and several important parameters. Below are some thoughts on the search syntax and key parameters for the TV News data set:\r\nKeyword: This is the most complex field and is where the search term is constructed. Be sure to read the blue info button. There is also a tutorial video that walks through some more complex search examples. Below are some search syntax rules:\r\nOnly exact keywords are matched. Eg. a search on russia will not return results for “russian” or “russians”.\r\nGroups of OR’d terms can be enclosed in parentheses. Eg. (russia OR russian OR russians) searches all three terms.\r\nPhrases are enclosed in quotes and may be as long as five terms. Eg. \"critical race theory\"\r\nPlace a - in front of terms or phrases to exclude these from searches. Eg. education -\"critical race theory\" returns clips containing education that do not also mention “critical race theory”.\r\nSearch terms are not translated. Therefore, words are language specific.\r\nIt is possible to search for terms that might be in adjacent 15 second clips using the context operator. Eg. clinton (context:\"email\" OR context:\"emails\" OR context:\"server\") returns all clips that contain clinton and which also contain either “email,” “emails,” or “server” either in the same or adjacent clips.\r\n\r\nTime Period: I generally request the entire time period. It can be filtered later in R.\r\nStations: This defaults to CNN, Fox, and MSNBC. For US news, I select all of the stations listed under Active National. There is also an optional market parameter that one can use, but calling it involves manually deleting the stations and replacing them with market=national. I am not aware of a way to do this via the GUI.\r\nCombine/Separate: One must choose whether values are Separate Stations with Multiple Timelines or Combine Stations for a Single Timeline. I am often interested in comparing values between stations and thus select Separate Stations for Multiple Timelines. If one is interested in the total volume of coverage on a given topic, then select Combine Stations to generate a Single Timeline. One can even envision a scenario where the same term might be searched both combined and single to see what portion of total coverage each individual station is responsible for.\r\nNormalized: If the plan is to make comparisons between stations or search terms, the data should be normalized.\r\nDate Resolution: Here one can set the units of time for which data are reported. If Time Period <7 days the Date Resolution defaults to hourly. If Time Period <3 years the Default Date resolution is daily, and when Time Period >3 years the default Date Resolution is monthly. These defaults can be overridden. I generally request daily resolution.\r\nTime Zone: The default is UTC. I personally do not change this, and believe it only has relevance when working with hourly Date Resolution data.\r\nSmoothing: The default is No Smoothing. I personally do not change this.\r\nStep 4: Displays\r\nSince the aim here is to obtain a data frame, the display parameters might not seem that important. However, by turning these settings on one can get a quick check on the search and also have a fuller sense of what was returned. For example, it can be informative to watch a couple of clips or review some of the visualizations. I recommend including zoomable timelines and including all displays possible. Note that for me the Google Trends Timeline does not function so I often turn it off.\r\nGetting the link\r\nOnce search parameters are determined it is time to generate an export URL. Below are the steps I use to get a request URL to pass to read_csv:\r\nUsing the GDELT Summary Explorer GUI set the search terms and execute a search. This returns a web page in a new browser tab. Eg. Here is the search summary for “critical race theory”.\r\nCheck the results page noting the “Data Source” and “Human Summary” fields to confirm that the desired search was submitted. If the search is not correct, modify and resubmit.\r\nIf the desired search was submitted, then copy the URL to a text document for future use. This is the permanent URL for this particular search and should be used when communicating results. I see that Dr. Leetaru uses links to the summary page as a reference. I follow that convention.\r\n\r\nIn the search results that are returned in the new page, find the “Export” hamburger menu and select “Save data as JSON”. This selection also returns a new web page in a new tab.\r\n\r\nIn that new tab, copy the URL and paste it into a text document.\r\nChange the format variable of the URL from format=json to format=csv.\r\nOnce the format parameter is changed, paste the modified URL into a read_csv() call. This will return the desired CSV file, which is read with read_csv(), and can be assigned to a variable like df.\r\nThe examples below use an export URL with read_csv to create a data frame which is then passed to ggplot.\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 41,139 x 4\r\n   date       network   value search                    \r\n   <date>     <chr>     <dbl> <chr>                     \r\n 1 2009-06-05 BLOOMBERG     0 \"\\\"critical race theory\\\"\"\r\n 2 2009-06-06 BLOOMBERG     0 \"\\\"critical race theory\\\"\"\r\n 3 2009-06-07 BLOOMBERG     0 \"\\\"critical race theory\\\"\"\r\n 4 2009-06-08 BLOOMBERG     0 \"\\\"critical race theory\\\"\"\r\n 5 2009-06-09 BLOOMBERG     0 \"\\\"critical race theory\\\"\"\r\n 6 2009-06-10 BLOOMBERG     0 \"\\\"critical race theory\\\"\"\r\n 7 2009-06-11 BLOOMBERG     0 \"\\\"critical race theory\\\"\"\r\n 8 2009-06-12 BLOOMBERG     0 \"\\\"critical race theory\\\"\"\r\n 9 2009-06-13 BLOOMBERG     0 \"\\\"critical race theory\\\"\"\r\n10 2009-06-14 BLOOMBERG     0 \"\\\"critical race theory\\\"\"\r\n# ... with 41,129 more rows\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComplex Searches\r\nBelow is an example illustrating a complex multi-term search on Critical Race Theory. One can see that the overall structure is similar to the prior figure but the amplitude of the highest peak is lower once some education related terms are used to constrain the search. This change in amplitude illustrates that a portion of the conversation around CRT is related to education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPI Request with newsflash::query_tv\r\nThe query_tv function of the newsflash library provides a quick and easy way to access the Television Archive data set. I would like to learn more about building wrappers of this kind. While I’m very impressed by query_tv there are some matters to be aware of.\r\nThe query_tv function returns monthly results for the full time range of the data set. This is suitable resolution for many purposes. However, if one wants daily, or finer, resolution data then another method of submitting requests is required because query_tv does not seem to have arguments for date resolution.\r\nThe query_tv only permits searching on a single term. This is equivalent to data displayed in and exportable from the Summary Overview Dashboard. Within query_tv I don’t see options for Comparison Visualization. If searches on a single query are all that is required query_tv may be appropriate, but it can’t handle query comparisons.\r\nAs far as I can tell, query_tv does not have arguments for using AND operators. The Explorer GUI accepts multi-word search terms in quotes and accepts multiple search terms defaulting to an AND operator. For example, \"critical race theory\" school\" returns a search of \"critical race theory\" AND school. At present I don’t see a way to accomplish that with query_tv. If the search doesn’t involve an AND operator, query_tv is a very efficient and quick tool.\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 1,350 x 4\r\n   network      date                value search              \r\n   <fct>        <dttm>              <dbl> <chr>               \r\n 1 Bloomberg    2009-07-01 12:00:00     0 critical race theory\r\n 2 CNBC         2009-07-01 12:00:00     0 critical race theory\r\n 3 CNN          2009-07-01 12:00:00     0 critical race theory\r\n 4 CSPAN        2009-07-01 12:00:00     0 critical race theory\r\n 5 CSPAN2       2009-07-01 12:00:00     0 critical race theory\r\n 6 CSPAN3       2009-07-01 12:00:00     0 critical race theory\r\n 7 FOX Business 2009-07-01 12:00:00     0 critical race theory\r\n 8 FOX News     2009-07-01 12:00:00     0 critical race theory\r\n 9 MSNBC        2009-07-01 12:00:00     0 critical race theory\r\n10 Bloomberg    2009-08-01 12:00:00     0 critical race theory\r\n# ... with 1,340 more rows\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe GDELT interface treats words in quotes as exact phrases. The query_tv documentation (line 17) states that “Anything found inside of quote marks is treated as an exact phrase search.” Therefore, consistent with the TV Explorer a search on “critical race theory” (as of Dec 12, 2021 n=454) should not produce the same results as “theory race critical” (as of Dec 12, 2021 n=0). Yet, with query_tv they produce identical results which can be confirmed by a quick check of identical(df1, df2) after running the code below. In this case it returns TRUE. While the query_tv wrapper is wonderful for quick single word searches of monthly data, unforeseen and easily overlooked issues like this lead me to recommend constructing queries via the GDELT Summary Explorer GUI. The Explorer GUI also has the advantage of reporting how it interpreted the query.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPI Requests with httr\r\nWhen launching out to try to understand how to access API’s via R I quickly encountered pages that discussed httr. I believe it to be a very common way of accessing API’s via R. Dataquest’s Tutorial on “Getting Started with APIs in R” was a useful introduction that illustrated how to use the httr library to make API requests. There are two working examples below. Using these methods, the data were returned as JSON and then converted.\r\nBasic API Request\r\nThe example below illustrates how to make a simple API call.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPI Request with additional parameters\r\nIt is also possible to use httr to make API calls and define parameters. This could hold some interesting promise for working with GDELT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequest to GDELT using httr: table embedded in JSON\r\nUsing the GET() method it was possible to issue a request to GEDELT 2.0 TV and receive JSON data. If format is set to csv it will return CSV data but not in a format I am not familiar with. It appears to be CSV data but in the RStudio Environment it lists the object as “Large response”. I’m not sure how to actually access the data.\r\n\r\nResponse [https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/tv/tv?format=csv&timespan=FULL&last24=yes&dateres=DAY&query=%22critical%20race%20theory%22%20(station:BLOOMBERG%20OR%20station:CNBC%20OR%20station:CNN%20OR%20station:CSPAN%20OR%20station:CSPAN2%20OR%20station:CSPAN3%20OR%20station:FBC%20OR%20station:FOXNEWS%20OR%20station:MSNBC%20)%20&mode=timelinevol&timezoom=yes]\r\n  Date: 2021-12-09 23:07\r\n  Status: 200\r\n  Content-Type: text/csv; charset=utf-8\r\n  Size: 802 kB\r\n<U+FEFF>Date (Daily +00:00: 06/05/2009 - 12/09/2021),Series,Value\r\n2009-06-05,BLOOMBERG,0\r\n2009-06-06,BLOOMBERG,0\r\n2009-06-07,BLOOMBERG,0\r\n2009-06-08,BLOOMBERG,0\r\n2009-06-09,BLOOMBERG,0\r\n2009-06-10,BLOOMBERG,0\r\n2009-06-11,BLOOMBERG,0\r\n2009-06-12,BLOOMBERG,0\r\n2009-06-13,BLOOMBERG,0\r\n...\r\n\r\nIf the request URL is set to format=json the data are returned but in a nested structure. The data of interest are broken into components and buried in a nested list. Assembling the desired table from this result would probably require pluck and bind_rows. The first item in the list is a list of the station names. The second item in the list is another list consisting of individual data frames for each of the stations.\r\n\r\n[1] \"Bloomberg\"    \"CNBC\"         \"CNN\"          \"CSPAN\"       \r\n[5] \"CSPAN2\"       \"CSPAN3\"       \"FOX Business\" \"FOX News\"    \r\n[9] \"MSNBC\"       \r\n\r\nGiven that when the API parameters are set to format=csv it will return a CSV file it makes more sense to pass the request directly to read_csv. It would be good in principle to know how to reassemble the desired table from the JSON data, but in this context it seems unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

On Friday March 13, 2020 ICE suspended family and social visitation. On March 27, 2020 ICE established the Guidance on COVID-19 web page and indicated the site would be updated frequently. Shortly afterwards I began logging the data on a daily basis, occasionally relying on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine’s regular scrapes of the page to pick up days that I missed. Results of those scrapes are contained in a github repository and key data including the total detained population (Figure 1), number of active COVID-19 cases in detention (Figure 2), cumulative COVID-19 cases (Figure 3), and total number of COVID-19 tests (Figure 4).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Current Total Detained Population\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen President Biden took office, the detained population was 14715. The lowest detention population was 13764 which was reported by ICE between March 9-15, 2021. This was just under three months into the Biden administration.

By early April 2021, as detention numbers started to rise, the number of active COVID-19 cases in detention shot up quickly.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, ICE began releasing national detention numbers on a semi-regular basis, and I work to track and graph those trends. Over the past few years, ICE began releasing year end detention reports that include monthly national summaries and annual summaries for individual detention facilities. Still, at the individual facility level it can be very difficult to obtain detention numbers beyond the annual average daily population summaries that are released in year end reports.\r\nMethod\r\nRecently, going through documents in the Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA), which reports bond related information, I discovered that for facilities established through revenue bonds, the financial disclosure statements may contain more fine grained data on detention populations.\r\nState level inspection of public records laws may be another method to obtain finer grained data worth pursuing.\r\nThe graph below is the first public image depicting monthly level detention numbers for the Otero County Processing Center (OCPC). The monthly detained population was gathered from the aforementioned revenue disclosure reports on EMMA and assembled into a table, which is hosted in a GitHub repository. Hopefully others may find review of EMMA filings useful for reconstructing more fine grained ICE detention information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Line plot showing monthly ICE detention population at OCPC as gleaned from EMMA filings. Note that in these filings, occupied detention beds are referred to as “Man Days”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterpretation\r\nUnfortunately, the data are still rather restricted in time and only span a single administration so it is not yet possible to track inter-administration policy impacts on detention. However, there are some very interesting trends to consider. At OCPC, detention numbers were declining before the beginning of the Trump administration and that trend continued for the first six months of his term. Notably, at the national level, immigration detention numbers were rising in the final years of the Obama administration and continued through 2020 at the start of the pandemic COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the overall national trend of increasing detention numbers, interestingly, detention numbers were decreasing at OCPC during the early months of the Trump administration. In October 2017 detention numbers at OCPC began to increase again. From that point, at OCPC detention numbers rose gradually over the next two years until the early months of 2020 just before the start of the pandemic.\r\nAs a regular visitor to OCPC, I recall speaking with detained persons in early 2020 and them telling me that there were few people in the facility. Though I was never able to determine why the facility was emptying out, many of us in the region suspected that ICE detention facilities along the border were being emptied in the event that the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) or Remain in Mexico policy would be over turned in the 9th Circuit. The thought was that ICE was creating bed space for a large influx of people who would be admitted when MPP was overturned. Unfortunately, MPP was not overturned remained in place until it was ended through Executive Order by Biden. However, it is clear that OCPC was starting to empty out months before the pandemic began in the US.\r\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, ICE visitation closed on March 13, 2020. After this date, through data obtained via EMMA one can see that detention numbers began to rise again at OCPC. It appears that, other than June 2020 when there was a slight uptick, detention numbers at OCPC have been falling since the first case of COVID-19 at the facility on April 20, 2020. At present, detention numbers nationally are rising in the early months of the Biden administration but do not appear to be rising at OCPC. However, I believe that OCPC is among the facilities that negotiated a guaranteed minimum deal with the Trump administration so MTC continues to make money on Ghost Beds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I’ve documented the work flow that I use to:\r\ncreate exams using R\r\nimport those exams to Canvas\r\nretrieval of individual Canvas class grade books using R\r\nbasic exploratory data analysis of a single course Canvas grade book\r\nretrieval of multiple Canvas class grade books\r\nbasic analysis of multiple Canvas grade books\r\nTo learn more about this work flow please visit the repository website.\r\n1 Creating Exams\r\nI began using R with Canvas during the pandemic. As classes were moved online I needed to port physical paper exams taken in person on Scantron to the university’s online LMS which happens to be Canvas. I generally write questions in plain text and find Canvas’s quiz question creation tool incredibly cumbersome. There are paid for tools to convert text or word documents to a Canvas quiz, and I tried one of the demos but I didn’t care for it. Fortunately, there is the wonderful R/Exams or simply exams package which, among its many functions, allows one to convert a series of R Markdown files into an exam which can be imported into Canvas.\r\n2 Retrieving Grades\r\nI generally keep a spreadsheet in each class that contains grade information. However, I find that from class to class or semester to semester, I usually end up manipulating each grade book in slightly different ways. While looking at grades isn’t exactly “research” there is some investigation going on. Therefore, I seemed like the reproducible research philosophy of R would lend itself well to consistency in the treatment of grades.\r\nFortunately, there is the rcanvas library that allows one to make a secure connection to Canvas. From there, it is possible to retrieve a class list and individual course grade books. There are several other functions that I have not explored.\r\nIn addition to retrieving the grade books, I go through a few of the wrangling methods for getting the data into shape for a bit of EDA.\r\n3 Analysis of Grades\r\nI’ve taught some of the same classes on different semesters and different years. For some time, I’ve been keen to look at grade trends over time. The use of rcanvas and tidyverse functions along with plotting libraries like ggplot2 and ggstatsplot made this possible and reproducible.\r\nI hope dear reader that you will find my documentation of how I use R with Canvas useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Sample plot showing scores of an exam created by the exams package, grades were retrieved by the rcanvas package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Developments are to emerge from the directly preceding situation, not from the idea of the whole.\r\n\r\n– Theodore Adorno and Max Horkheimer (2002, 109), “The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception” from Dialectic of Enlightenment: Philosophical Fragments.\r\n1 Introduction\r\nDid 2020 mark a watershed moment in public discourse regarding Critical Race Theory (CRT)? If yes, why and in what context? In a recent article, Adam Harris suggests 2020 was a watershed moment in public discourse regarding CRT, current coverage is largely in conservative media outlets, and overwhelmingly negative. Harris’s propositions are examined and evaluated by exploring large sources of mass media content using basic methods of distant reading and relating those trends to relevant events. Results confirm Harris’s assertions and build on his model. New findings include the fact that much of the uptick in negative coverage appears to have occurred after the inauguration of Biden and is focused on hyperbolic concerns regarding the teaching of CRT in schools. It is suggested that the coverage represents an effort on the part of conservative media to establish a moral panic to create backlash against forms of CRT that are being promoted in classrooms.\r\n2 Background\r\nOn May 7, 2021 Adam Harris (2021) published an essay in The Atlantic Monthly entitled “The GOP’s ‘Critical Race Theory’ Obsession.” The article begins by looking at a series of controversial, and likely unconstitutional, new bills in states like New Hampshire, Arkansas, and Idaho that forbid the teaching of “divisive concepts” among which are the concept of critical race theory (CRT) a theory developed in the 1970’s by Harvard Law Professor Derrick Bell (2008). CRT has continued to develop and is now applied in a diversity of fields including education (Delgado and Stefancic 2017), which I suggest is a key point of contention in conservative media representations of CRT.\r\n2.1 Select Moments in Derrick Bell’s Career Related to CRT\r\nHarris traces some of the contours of Bell’s career describing Bell as the only Black professor of law on the faculty at Harvard and his eventual resignation of a post due to what he felt were discriminatory hiring practices. Harris writes, “[i]n 1980, Bell resigned his position at Harvard because of what he viewed as the institution’s discriminatory hiring practices, especially its failure to hire an Asian American woman he’d recommended.” In an obituary for Bell, Bernstein (2011), provides a slightly different scenario:\r\n\r\nIn 1980 he [Bell] left Harvard to become dean of the University of Oregon School of Law, but he resigned in 1985 when the school did not offer a position to an Asian-American woman. After returning to Harvard in 1986, he staged a five-day sit-in in his office to protest the school’s failure to grant tenure to two professors whose work involved critical race theory.\r\n\r\nMuch of CRT was laid out in Bell’s (2008) 1973 Race, Racism, and American Law. I first encountered Bell’s ideas reading Martha Escobar’s (2016) Captivity Beyond Prisons. I was drawn to her application of Bell’s (1991) essay on a related theme he titled “Racial Realism.” The essay impacted my thinking significantly. As an anthropologist, often myopically, fixated on culture I was struck by Bell’s use of the theory of legal realism, which his essay introduced to me. Painting with broad strokes one can say that, legal realism is generally the idea that law and its administration are embedded in and influenced by social contexts, mores, and biases. I was stunned to learn that this was not orthodox legal thinking. I found Bell’s thesis, as I understood it, compelling to the point of being axiomatic and that the orthodox antithesis of legal formalism–that law is objective and neutral, sitting outside of society, as an untenable proposition given my view of culture as all encompassing (Stocking 1966, and many others) and shaped by practice (Bourdieu 2019).\r\nIn his essay, Harris describes how Black students at Harvard began discussing Bell’s ideas after his departure from that institution. Bell clearly influenced a cadre of students and inspired many, including a future president (and it seems a second but negatively). Still, at the time of Bell’s life, despite the significant influence of his ideas within the academy, it seems that CRT was not widely discussed outside of academic circles. This is unsurprising given that few scholarly theories, even those that are wildly influential within the academy, make it into broader public conversation. Still, CRT is presently (as I show below) in the center of public discourse.\r\n2.2 CRT Enters Public Discourse\r\nHarris narrates a model of when and how CRT began to play a larger role in public conversations. Specifically, he suggests that CRT came to the forefront with Bill Clinton’s nomination of U. Penn Law School professor Lani Guinier to head up the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. Dubbed by the “Quota Queen” by political opponents, Republicans began to launch an offensive against her nomination basing it part on her support for CRT. As Harris states:\r\n\r\nThe theory [of CRT] soon stood in for anything resembling an examination of America’s history with race. Conservatives would boil it down further: Critical race theory taught Americans to hate America. Today, across the country, school curricula and workplace trainings include materials that defenders and opponents alike insist are inspired by critical race theory but that academic critical race theorists do not characterize as such.\r\n\r\nHaving read some, though certainly not all of Bell’s work, I find it a stretch that Bell preached hatred of the US. In fact, given that he worked for a time as a U.S. Attorney in the Department of Justice it seems a curious claim. Interestingly, he did not seem to have been treated well by the department. The DOJ at one point force Bell to choose between giving up his membership with the NAACP or leave the DOJ. Bell chose to leave the DOJ and retain his membership in the NCAA. Still, despite these and other unreasonable challenges Bell faced as a pioneering Black legal mind, it is hard to find hatred in his writing. It may seem pessimistic at times, “[r]acial equality is, in fact, not a realistic goal” he once wrote (Bell 1991, 363) his point being that “constantly aiming for a status that is unobtainable in a perilously racist America, black Americans face frustration and despair.” Yet, this is no reason to give up he argued because “[c]ontinued struggle can bring about unexpected benefits and gains that in themselves justify continued endeavor. The fight in itself has meaning and should give us hope for the future” (Bell 1991, 387). This line of argument strikes me as blunt, but not hateful.\r\n\r\n2.3 Contemporary CRT\r\nAs a popular and influential academic idea, CRT continued to grow even after Bell’s passing. Contemporary practicing proponents of CRT (Delgado and Stefancic 2017, 8–11) assert that: racism is an ordinary (though obviously undesirable) condition of society and not an aberration; that white-over-color ascendancy exists and serves multiple purposes for the dominant group; races are social constructs, the products of social though and relations; dominant society racalizes minority groups in different ways at different times, often in relation to changing labor demands; each socially constructed racial group has its own origins and unfolding history; and because of these diverse origins whites may not understand the experiences or struggles of racalized minorities. Boiled down to these essential kernels, at least to this anthropologist it seems that CRT isn’t radical white bashing or America thrashing, but a constellation of reasoned positions derived from established diverse social science perspectives. If racism is an issue to resolve in society, how is one to address it with out candidly acknowledging its existence and assiduously defining its contours?\r\n\r\nAs with many academic theories (i.e. natural selection), in public discourse, nuance gets glossed to the point of abstraction beyond recognition. So it seems with characterizations of CRT as spiteful “America hating” racist propaganda which seems, at least from the clips above and another below, to be the perspective of Fox. Harris suggests that up until last year, Fox News gave only currsory attention to CRT with the first mention of it in 2012 when Bell passed. At the time, Fox apparently ran footage of Obama lauding Bell’s theories and embracing him physically (Figure 1). For outlets like Fox, and the budding Breitbart, this was evidence of Obama’s racial radicalism. As John Cook (2012) wrote at the time:\r\nThe New York Times obituary (Bernstein 2011), indicates Bell passed in October 2011.\r\n\r\nBarack Obama, in 1990, gave a speech saying nice things about a bad man named Derrick Bell. He also hugged the bad man, Derrick Bell. Ipso facto reduction ad absurdum habeas corpus hocus pocus, Barack Obama is a bad man as well. Airtight.\r\n\r\nFox host Sean Hanity, Harris suggests, mentioned CRT in 2014 when discussing George Zimmerman’s trial for the murder of Trayvon Martin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Barrack Obama and Derrick Bell\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.4 CRT and Executive Order 13950\r\nHarris suggests Fox hosts began discussing CRT more frequently in 2020, after footage surfaced of Derek Chauvin slowly murdering George Floyd, and anti-racist literature surged to the forefront of the national conversation. Harris identifies Christopher Rufo, who published a July 9, 2020 essay opposing anti-racist training in Seattle schools, as being largely responsible for conservative media’s current passion regarding CRT. In early September of 2020, Rufo went on Fox’s Tucker Carlson show to talk about how the government was being “weaponized” against Americans and Rufo called on then President Donald Trump to take action.\r\nPrior to 2020, the Fox-Trump feedback loop was already well documented (Gertz 2018; Maza 2018; Chang 2017). This same feedback loop appears to have played a role in the making of public policy regarding CRT. On September 22, 2020, less than a month after Mr. Rufo made his plea to Trump on Fox, Trump signed an Executive Order (EO) 13950 entitled “Combating Race and Sex Stereotyping.” The order explicitly included prohibitions on the teaching “divisive concepts” by federally funded agencies. Though not mentioned by name in the order, it is abundantly clear that CRT was among the order’s intended targets of “divisive concepts.”\r\nFortunately, EO 13950 was promptly challenged in courts and rescinded by Biden upon taking office through the issuance of EO 13985 “Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government.” However, before that change, at my university (a Hispanic serving institution located on the US-Mexico border), on October 14, 2020 members of my department received an ominous pdf from the Dean of the College regarding EO 13950. The file indicated that the target of EO 13950 was “workforce/employee training” and applied to “federal contractors, and subcontractors, federal agencies, employers receiving federal grants, Armed Services/ROTC.”\r\nOffice of Management and Budget indicated that divisive concepts could be discussed but only “in an objective manner and without endorsement,” which the university suggested “appears to carve out academic instruction.” Set aside the fact that this assertion relies on the flimsy premise that objectivity is even possible, which of coarse since we are all human beings with perspectives it is not (c.f. Merleau-Ponty 1962). Still, apparently this carve out was only under the condition that discussion was done without endorsement–meaning one can’t say “given assembled evidence, this idea appears to have merits,” “this theory holds explanatory power,”or even “the idea is compelling personally, what do you think?” Among the divisive concepts, CRT topped the list. Clearly, CRT was an intellectual pariah not to be discussed except “in an objective manner” which phenomenology asserts is not possible. At least to my knowledge, within my department, and certainly within my classes, EO 13950 went unheded, and if anything prompted the Streisand effect leading to discussions on the importance of intellectual freedoms.\r\n2.5 Summary and Research Question\r\nMy limited understanding of CRT revolves largely around two of Bell’s arguments. The first is the “interest convergence thesis,” that racial equality will only be accommodated when it converges with the interest of whites. Self interest is a common assumption among an incredibly diverse range of social science theories. The second is the “racial realist thesis” that law is impacted by society and social processes, which in the case of the United States entails prejudicial treatment of people of color. The assertion that law is part of and influenced by society is hardly radical. As someone who studies immigration detention and mass incarceration, which are wildly prejudicial against people of color, my understanding of at least two components of Bell’s project strike me as an entirely tenable arguments. Being interested in Harris’s assertions about negative discussions of CRT–specifically the timing and nature of coverage in public discourse I attempted to pursue the question further.\r\nDid 2020 represent a watershed moment ushering in significant negative coverage of CRT on Fox news?\r\n3 Method\r\nTo address changing coverage of CRT in public discourse, I adopted aspects of the “culturomics” Michel et al. (2011) approach which involves distant reading (Schulz 2011; Moretti 2013) of large quantities of text and can be extended in principle to other kinds of mass media big data–like TV news chyrons. I adhere to the position that print capital and other forms of mass media can be powerful tools for crafting an imagined community (Anderson 2006) and that systematic programming for a specific purpose can, like advertising, shape public opinion (Wolfe 2018; Ellul 1973). Thus, monitoring these broadcasts can reveal important insights regarding social movements, like CRT and reactions against it.\r\nThe term “critical race theory” was searched in three data sets:\r\nGoogle Ngram Viewer\r\nGlobal Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) Internet Archive TV News Chyrons from 2006 to the present. This data set parses coverage by news network.\r\nGDELT Global Online News Coverage data set from 2017 to the present. This data set includes information the tone of coverage.\r\nIn Google’s Ngram Viewer, both the terms “critical race theory” and “culture wars” were searched. The latter was included because Harris’s article mentions “culture wars” along with the term CRT. The Google Ngram Viewer is an outgrowth of Michel et al.’s (2011) “cultoromics.” I used the ngramr (Carmody 2020) package to query the data set and graph the search results, then I annotated that graph with key dates identified by Harris. For the GDELT data sets, I exported a comma delimited file that was wrangled with the tidyverse package (Wickham 2019) which was plotted and annotated with ggplot2 (Wickham et al. 2020).\r\nUnfortunately, the Google Ngram corpus only extends up to 2019 and many of the events Harris discusses occur in 2020. Moreover, TV news and specifically Fox news is a key place where Harris argues CRT is discussed in negative terms. To follow up on this, I searched two different data sets in GDELT’s “Lower Third” project which is a database of news chyrons. The term “culture wars” was not searched in the two GDELT data sets. The GDELT Internet Archive TV News data set permits searching coverage of a term by specifc networks. The GDELT Global Online News Coverage archive does not parse by network but assigns a level of sentiment to the news coverage of a given topic.\r\n4 Results\r\n4.1 Google ngram Data Set\r\nAn initial view of Google’s Ngram Viewer database shows no mention of CRT prior to the 1980’s (Figure 2), a decade after the theory’s formulation in 1973. Narrowing down the span of coverage shows an increase in the use of the term in the late 1980’s, after leaving Harvard (to take a Deanship at University of Oregon) but before Clinton nominates Lani Guinier (Figure 3). Figure 3 indicates the early 1990’s was a major inflection point of increasing use of the term in print media. Throughout the period from the late 1980’s up to Derrick Bell’s pasing in 2011, the term “Culture Wars” is used more frequently than CRT. However, within a few years of Bell’s passing CRT surpassed “Culture Wars” in print sources. This is in part because the term “Culture Wars” began to wane in frequency after about 2009 while at the same time the frequency of CRT continued to climb steadily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: ngram showing frequency of the term “Critical Race Theory” as it appears in the ‘English 2019’ corpus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: ngram showing frequency of the term “Critical Race Theory” as it appears in the ‘English 2019’ corpus between 1970-2019\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.2 GDELT Internet Archive TV News Chyron Data Set\r\nThe GDELT Internet Archive TV News data set allows tracking of the term CRT from 2006 to the present across six TV networks. Figure 4 shows there is a slight increase in news coverage of the term not long after Bell’s passing. Looking more closely at the months before and after Bell’s passing (Figure 5) reveals three instances of Fox coverage, two before Bell passes and once after. CSPAN is the network that covered CRT immediately following Bell’s passing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: GDELT Internet Archive TV News Chyron dataset showing coverage of “Critical Race Theory” 2006-Present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most notable spike is in the early months of 2012 and the majority of the coverage occurred on CNN. This spike, which occurred on march 7, 2012 corresponds to Breitbart releasing the Obama video mentioned above. On May 8, Breitbart Editor-In-Chief “Joel Pollak clashed with [CNN] host Soledad O’Brien about the significance of the video” and CRT (Crugnale 2012). Pollak claimed the video was a “bombshell” because Bell’s CRT “holds that the civil rights movement was a sham” and that the theory was racist. That same day the conservative National Review published an article suggesting furor over the Obama-Bell video was not significant (French 2012). Also on may 8, The Atlantic ran a piece by conservative writer Conor Friedersdorf (2012) who said “the controversy [over the video] is a big nothing-burger,” and concluded the essay asserting that “[t]o label someone as a racist for honesty conveying his dark view of human nature is the sort of politically correct, reductive stifling of speech that conservatives are supposed to stand against.” While some actors in conservative media (Brietbart and Fox) were promoting outrage over the video, other conservative venues (National Review) and writers (Friedersdorf ) characterized it as a tempest in a teapot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: GDELT Internet Archive TV News Chyron dataset showing coverage of “Critical Race Theory” 2010-2013\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking at the period of time from 2020 to the present, after the murder of George Floyd, there is a slight increase in coverage of CRT on Fox (Figure 6). However, this coverage increases sharply with the appearance of C. Rufo on the network and begins to decline. Interestingly, mentions of CRT continue to decline through the signing of Trump’s EO 13950 It is not until January 2021 that coverage of CRT begins to sharply spike with nearly all of that coverage being on Fox. By April 2021, other networks begin to pick up coverage of CRT by only following a massive spike on Fox that begins in January 2021. Notably, the period leading up to and following the swearing in of Biden is associated with a sharp increase in Fox coverage of CRT. What is the tone of that coverage? As the news clips in the Introduction show, Fox’s coverage often expresses concern with the teaching of CRT in schools. In fact, reviewing post 2020 coverage of CRT on Fox, this seems to be the overwhelming source of concern for the network.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: GDELT Internet Archive TV News Chyron dataset showing coverage of “Critical Race Theory” 2020-Present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.3 GDELT Global Online News Coverage Chyron Data Set\r\nThe GDELT Global Online News Coverage Chyron data set does not permit parsing of coverage by network or station. However, this data set does provide information on the volume of TV news coverage as well as a measure of that coverage’s tone. Figure 7 shows generally low level coverage of CRT before the latter half of 2020 with two small spikes of coverage, the first occurring in the early part of 2017 and the other in the latter half of 2019. The majority of coverage Volume Intensity occurs after June 2020, which represents the period after Floyd’s murder and around the time of C. Rufo’s appearance on Fox. On average, with a slight rise in the middle of 2018 and another in early 2020, the coverage is of a generally negative tone (Figure 8).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: GDELT Global Online News Coverage dataset showing Volume Intensity and Average Tone of coverage of “Critical Race Theory” 2017-Present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8: GDELT Global Online News Coverage dataset showing Average Tone of coverage of “Critical Race Theory” 2017-Present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking more closely at the period from July 2019 to the present, it is clear that coverage starts to spike around August, 2021 and the coverage is almost entirely negative (Figure 9 and 10). George Floyd murder does not seem to correspond with an uptick in Volume Intensity, but corresponds precisely with the greatest negative Average Tone in the entire series. C. Rufo’s appearance on Fox corresponds with a major peak in Volume Intensity but does not register a major anomaly in Average Tone, though Average Tone regarding CRT was already declining since the murder of George Floyd. There is no major spike in Volume Intensity corresponding with the signing of EO 13950, nor does the moment stand out in regards to Average Tone. There is a spike in Volume Intensity when Biden was sworn in, and there is a small negative Average Tone anomaly that precedes Biden’s inauguration. Referring back to the previous section and Figure 6 it is clear that nearly all of the coverage of CRT since September 2020 is on Fox. Samples of key clips from Fox covering the theme of CRT, it seems consistently linked with both the 1619 project and the teaching of CRT in schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 9: GDELT Global Online News Coverage dataset showing coverage of “Critical Race Theory” 2020-Present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 10: GDELT Global Online News Coverage dataset showing Average Tone of coverage of “Critical Race Theory” 2019-Present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 Discussion\r\nHarris proposed that while Fox had given negative coverage to CRT in the past, its current fixation is a recent effort to rekindle the Culture Wars, began to increase after the murder of George Floyd, and was specifically prompted by C. Rufo’s appearance on Fox (who is on the left in the clip above). Google’s Ngram Viewer indicates that mentions of CRT didn’t begin until the early 1990’s (Figure 3), that mentions of CRT have grown steadily and eventually in 2010 surpassed “Culture Wars” in terms of frequency of use. GDELT’s Internet Archive TV News data set shows a staggering increase in coverage of CRT after the Murder of George Floyd (Figure 4) and it appears very tightly timed with C. Rufo’s September 2020 appearance on Fox (Figure 6. It seems that coverage of C. Rufo prompted Trump to sign EO 13950 attempting to control the teaching of “divisive concepts” with federal funds. Materials I received at my institution named CRT at the top of the list of “divisive concepts.” While Rufo’s plea on Fox may have prompted Trump to take action, and serves as another example of the Fox-Trump feedback loop, coverage of CRT continued to wane through this period. It was not until the months leading up to Biden’s swearing in that Fox began covering CRT again and with more volume than ever recorded. The GDELT Global Online News Coverage data set shows that coverage overwhelmingly negative (Figures 7 through 10). Significantly, the moment of greatest negative Average Tone regarding CRT, occurred exactly when George Floyd was murdered, though Volume Intensity does not pick up until C. Rufo’s appearance on Fox. Sampling of individual clips, like those presented throughout this essay, show that Fox’s negative coverage emphasizes the teaching of CRT in schools. The most recent coverage appears to be simulated by proposals from within the Biden administration to address social inequality.\r\nWhile the data reviewed here may suggest slight variations on the scenario presented by Harris, his propositions are largely corroborated by a “culturomic” Michel et al. (2011) distant reading (Schulz 2011; Moretti 2013) of large quantities of printed text and TV news chyrons. This approach allowed for a tighter temporal focus, a clear sense of the amplitude of change, and afforded some qualitative spot checking of the actual coverage. The question remains, why do some conservative media outlets seem to have this “obsession” with negative portrayals of CRT?\r\nStanley Cohen’s (2011b, 2011a) “Moral Panic” theory (MPT) is another highly influential academic idea whose name made it into general public discourse. However, both MPT and CRT are frequently over simplified into unfaithfully unrecognizable abstractions. Cohen’s MPT is about collective over reactions to what are perceived as threatening “folk devils,” essentially scapegoats, that are believed to pose a far greater danger to society than they actuality do. Within MPT there are debates as to where in social panics originate. Are they spontaneous and come from the populous (bottom up); are they crafted by elites (top down); or do they come from moral entrepreneurs and coalitions somewhere in between (middle out)? There are compelling arguments for all three models of process, they aren’t mutually exclusive, and instead represent diverging fruitful extensions of Cohen’s initial ideas. Regardless of the source of the panic, media plays a key and critical role in propagating and sustaining the outrage and over reaction in each of the proposed sources of moral panics (Goode and Ben-Yehuda 2009; Critcher et al. 2013). Since print capital and mass media are central to forging the imagined community (Anderson 2006), the notion that mass media plays a key role in the propagation of moral panics comes as little surprise.\r\nWhile there are many variations on MPT, few address moral panics that arise out of ideas alone–most are about classes of “dangerous” people–Cohen’s folk devils. Fox’s coverage seems to link CRT with Black Lives Matter, which can be construed as a potential folk devil in the sense of Cohen’s theory. However, the folk devils of moral panics are not generally intellectual theories–but I see no reason they couldn’t be.\r\n6 Conclusion\r\nCRT, which from my admittedly incomplete reading, seems perfectly well reasoned based on both historical fact and widely accepted assertions about individual and group behavior– strikes me not as a dangerous idea but a penetrating intellectual analysis worth consideration. As human constructs, all theories are imperfect and thus they need to be challenged and defended on civil terms; this dialectic process strengthen theory. Yet, tilting at theoretical windmills won’t advance intellectual understanding, it just leads to confusion.\r\nPerhaps some school applications of CRT are misguided and in need of calibration, I can’t yet say. However, given the misrepresentation of other theories in educational settings that is not beyond the imaginable. While I have not reviewed individual school curricula in question, which may deviate from the core of CRT, Fox’s coverage and Mr. Rufo’s characterizations seem more like fictional straw-men than faithful renditions.\r\nFox’s presentation of CRT, which is a soundly argued legal theory, as espousing white self loathing and hatred of the nation, is at the most generous I can muster–misguided over reaction. Even conservative writers have expressed concern over exaggerated treatments of CRT by the likes of Breitbart and Fox. At worse, the high volume of hyperbolically negative treatment of CRT by Fox suggests a calculated effort to create a moral panic by casting those who embrace anti-racist theory as dangerous folk devils who threaten the very fabric of society. The general expense of media coverage, the recent explosion of that coverage, its generally narrow sources, coupled with the explicit effort to organize and exercise political power to oppose CRT, point towards efforts to conjure a media base middle out moral panic, essentially systematic propagandizing, designed to sway public opinion. Intriguingly the panic seems largely directed at a theory, but is likely painted on those who espouse the ideas of CRT. Rather than name the problem of racism, define it, and work on the issue, some–it would seem, are unsatisfied merely ignoring the problem’s existence–but seek to actively assert that addressing issue head on with clear eyes is itself a dangerous and divisive act. In many ways, Fox’s pearl clutching and moral panic over fabricated forms of CRT is actually well predicted by the theory itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnderson, Benedict R. O’G. 2006.

The data on this page are now updated regularly and may be subject to change in the future. This post examines one snapshot in time. Future posts may attempt to further track changes over time.\r\nIn addition to looking at Guaranteed Minimums, effort is made here to examine the number of empty Guaranteed Minimum beds which, following Selman and Leighton’s (2010, 114) term of “ghost inmates” which originates in the private and for-profit corrections incarceration sector, are referred to here as “Ghost Beds.” As Selman and Leighton note because private prisons operate and make money on economies of scale, many for-profit private prison contracts contain clauses that facilities must remain 90% full and if they aren’t the contracts are structured to guaranteed payment for a minimum number of incarcerated persons. ICE facilities, both publicly and privately run, contain Guaranteed Minimums which are listed in the FY21 year to date report.\r\nICE’s FY21 year to date report lists each facility’s type, Average Daily Population (ADP) and contractual Guaranteed Minimums. Based on ADP and Guaranteed Minimums, it is possible to estimate the number of empty guaranteed beds or Ghost Beds. It is also possible to explore patterns of ADP, Guaranteed Minimums, and Ghost Beds by facility type.\r\n1.1 Summary\r\nFor those who may not wish to read through the entire data exploration. A brief summary of some key findings are reported below.\r\nSection 2 data exploration begins by looking at facility types, which appears in ICE’s data set as Type Detailed, as well as ADP by Type Detailed. Private facilities are the most common facility type, though arrangements with US Marshals Service (USMS) are also extremely common. It bears mention that USMS contracts with ICE are under studied and extremely problematic (Jameson 2020). Not technically private contracts, they operate on a distinct business model related to procurement. While Service Processing Centers (SPC) have the highest ADP by type, Inter-Governmental Service Agreements (IGSA) and Contract Detention Facilities (CDF) are more numerous.\r\nSection 3 looks at Guaranteed Minimums generally and by Type Detailed. At present, there are 34390 guaranteed beds distributed among 50 facilities. There is a strong correlation between total ADP, termed Total Detained and Guaranteed Minimum, Total Detained population explains 46% of the variation in Guaranteed Minimums. As a type, IGSA’s have the largest share of Guaranteed Minimums overall, which is just under 2/3. On average, among facilities with Guaranteed Minimums, IGSA’s tend to have larger Guaranteed Minimums and IGSA’s are more numerous as a type. However, CDF’s, with just under 1/3, also have a large portion of Guaranteed Minimums. IGSA’s and CDF’s make up 90% of the facilities with Guaranteed Minimums and 92% of the Guaranteed Minimum beds.\r\nSection 4 looks at Ghost Beds generally, by Type Detailed and explores Guaranteed Minimum as well as Ghost Bed costs. The mean Guaranteed Minimum per diem is $123.04 (SD=43.02). The total estimated cost of Guaranteed Minimums is $4,308,391 per day, $129,251,730 per month, or $1,572,562,715 per year. At present 2/3 of Guaranteed Minimums are empty Ghost Beds. At the present rate of Ghost Beds, which may change, the total estimated cost is $2,952,525 per day, $88,575,750 per month, or $1,077,671,625 per year.\r\n2 Facility Types\r\nThe FY21 year to date report lists 142 facilities, five of which are not located on the continental US. ICE lists six kinds of facilities:\r\nBureau of Prisons (BOP) are public facilities.\r\nContract Detention Facilities (CDF), these are private facilities generally owned by a private prison company.\r\nIntergovernmental Service Agreement (IGSA), these are privately managed facilities owned by a county or municipality whose management is subcontracted to a private prison company.\r\nService Processing Centers (SPC), are public facilities managed by ICE though often the security staff are subcontracted to a private company.\r\nUS Marshals Service Intergovernmental Agreement (USMS IGA) are established US Marshals contracts with local jails that are used by ICE for immigration detention purposes. USMS IGA’s may be a mix of public and private facilities depending on whether local governments subcontract out jail management to a private contractor.\r\nOther\r\nThe five ICE detention facilities located outside of the continental US are:\r\nHonolulu Federal Detention Center, HI\r\nHiland Mountain Correctional Center, AK\r\nGuaynabo MDC PR\r\nDepartment Of Corrections GU\r\nSaipan Department Of Corrections MP\r\n2.1 Facility Counts by Facility Type\r\nTable 1 and Figure 2 show that by count the most common type of facility are IGSA’s (n=73) followed by USMS IGAs (n=39), and CDF (n=17). IGSA’s andCDF’s are private and USMS IGA’s may be a mix of public and private local jails (see list above). Regardless, between IGSA’s and CDF’s 63% (n=90) of ICE detention facilities by count are unambiguously privately managed. USMS IGA’s still operate more as “procurement not policy” in what is an “opaque and intricate business practice” (Jameson 2020: 283) in which local counties and municipalities view detention as a key source of income (Jameson 2020: 2839).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Map of ICE detention facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1: Count and Percent Total Facilities by Type.\r\n\r\n\r\nType Detailed\r\n\r\n\r\nn\r\n\r\n\r\n% Total Facilities\r\n\r\n\r\nBOP\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\n1.41\r\n\r\n\r\nSPC\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\n3.52\r\n\r\n\r\nOther\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\n4.23\r\n\r\n\r\nCDF\r\n\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\n\r\n11.97\r\n\r\n\r\nUSMS IGA\r\n\r\n\r\n39\r\n\r\n\r\n27.46\r\n\r\n\r\nIGSA\r\n\r\n\r\n73\r\n\r\n\r\n51.41\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Bar chart of ICE detention facilities by facility type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3 shows were ICE detention facilities are located based on facility type. IGSA’s and USMS IGA’s are more spread out while CDF’s, SPC’s, and Others are primarily located along the southern border.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Facet map of ICE detention facilities by facility type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.2 ADP by Facility Type\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on ICE’s FY2021 year to date data table, the total ADP is presently 15,535, which is generally consistent with the detained population reported on the ICE Guidance on COVID-19 page for this time period. Examining total ADP by facility type shows that IGSA’s (n=8999) and CDF’s (n=3567), which are both private kinds of facilities, make up 81% (n=12566) of the total ADP (see Table 2. However, IGSA’s (n=73) and CDF’s (n=17) make up 63% of the total number of facilities. They hold a larger portion of the total ADP because these kinds of facilities are generally larger, though at present SPC’s appear to have a higher mean ADP though there are few of this kind of facility (n=5).\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 2: Summary statistics of ADP by ICE detention facility type.\r\n\r\n\r\nType Detailed\r\n\r\n\r\nn\r\n\r\n\r\n% Total Facilities\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal ADP\r\n\r\n\r\nMean ADP\r\n\r\n\r\nSD ADP\r\n\r\n\r\n% Total ADP\r\n\r\n\r\nBOP\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\n1.41\r\n\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\n\r\n10.00\r\n\r\n\r\n9.90\r\n\r\n\r\n0.13\r\n\r\n\r\nCDF\r\n\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\n\r\n11.97\r\n\r\n\r\n3567\r\n\r\n\r\n209.82\r\n\r\n\r\n188.57\r\n\r\n\r\n22.96\r\n\r\n\r\nIGSA\r\n\r\n\r\n73\r\n\r\n\r\n51.41\r\n\r\n\r\n8999\r\n\r\n\r\n123.27\r\n\r\n\r\n139.88\r\n\r\n\r\n57.93\r\n\r\n\r\nOther\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\n4.23\r\n\r\n\r\n177\r\n\r\n\r\n29.50\r\n\r\n\r\n48.88\r\n\r\n\r\n1.14\r\n\r\n\r\nSPC\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\n3.52\r\n\r\n\r\n1349\r\n\r\n\r\n269.80\r\n\r\n\r\n121.26\r\n\r\n\r\n8.68\r\n\r\n\r\nUSMS IGA\r\n\r\n\r\n39\r\n\r\n\r\n27.46\r\n\r\n\r\n1423\r\n\r\n\r\n36.49\r\n\r\n\r\n45.43\r\n\r\n\r\n9.16\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking at the distribution of ADP by ICE detention facility type, one can see that SPC’s have the highest mean ADP (M=269.80, SD=121.26), while CDF’s (M=209.82, SD=188.57) and IGSA’s (M=123.27, SD=139.88) have the next highest mean ADP (see Table 2). A combined violin-sina plot (Figure 4) illustrates the distribution of ADP by ICE detention facility type (Hintze and Nelson 1998; Sidiropoulos et al. 2018). So while SPC’s presently have larger detained populations on average, IGSA’s and CDF’s are far more numerous. While USMS IGA’s (n= 39) are the second most numerous kind of facility they have a comparatively lower total ADP (n=1423) or by facility average ADP (M=36.49, SD=45.43).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Violin and Sina plot of ADPs by ICE detention facility type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Guaranteed Minimums\r\nOf the 142 facilities reported by ICE in the FY21 year to date dataset, 35% (n=50) have contractual guaranteed minimums (Table 3). The Pearson’s product-moment correlation between Guaranteed Minimum and Total Detained is positive, statistically significant, and very large (\\(r = 0.68, t(48) = 6.40, p < .001\\)). A linear model (estimated using OLS) was applied to predict Guaranteed Minimum with Total Detained. The model explains a statistically significant and substantial proportion of variance (\\(R^2 = 0.46, F(1, 48) = 40.91, p < .001, adj. R^2 = 0.45\\)).

SPC’s average 528 guaranteed beds per facility which is the lowest of the three types. So SPC’s have guaranteed minimums at the highest rate, but they make up a relatively small proportion of the facilities with guaranteed minimums, and a small proportion of the total number of guaranteed beds.\r\nThere are 30 IGSA’s that have guaranteed minimums, 41% of this facility type has guaranteed minimums, they constitute 60% of the facilities with guaranteed minimums, which comprises 61.95 of all guaranteed minimum beds. IGSA’s average 710.17 guaranteed beds per facility which is the highest of any of the three types. IGSA’s constitute the majority of facilities with guaranteed minimums and the majority of guaranteed minimum beds. IGSA’s also have the highest per facility guaranteed minimum average. The four facilities with the most number of guaranteed minimum beds are all IGSA’s (Table 3.\r\nThere are 15 CFS that have guaranteed minimums, 88% of this type of facility has guaranteed minimums, they make up 10% of all facilities with guaranteed minimums , which comprises 30% of all guaranteed minimum beds, and as a type averages 696.2 guaranteed beds per facility. Thus, a very high proportion of this facility type has guaranteed minimums, but they make up a relatively small proportion of the total number of facilities with guaranteed minimums. CFS’s have average guaranteed minimums that are relatively close to IGSA’s.\r\nTogether, CDF’s and IGSA’s constitute 90% of the facilities with guaranteed minimums and 92% of the guaranteed minimum beds (Figure 6).

The Pearson’s product-moment correlation between Ghost Beds and Total Detained is positive, statistically significant, and very large (\\(r = 0.43, t(48) = 3.30, p < .01\\)). Using a linear model to predict Ghost Beds by Total Detained (Figure 7) explains a statistically significant and moderate proportion of variance (\\(R^2 = 0.18, F(1, 48) = 10.88, p = 0.002, adj. R^2 = 0.17\\)). The effect of Total Detained on Ghost Beds is statistically significant and positive (\\(b = 1.07,t(48) = 3.30, p < .01\\)). Total Detained explains about 18% of Ghost Beds. This is probably related to the fact that Total Detained predicts the amount of Guaranteed Minimum (Section 3).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Scatterplot of Ghost Beds by Total Detained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes the amount of Guaranteed Minimum explain the presence and amount of Ghost Beds?

Just as all SPC’s have guaranteed minimums, all SPC’s also have ghost beds, and they make up 10% of the facilities with ghost beds. There are a total of 1293 ghost beds in SPC’s representing 5.63% of the total number of ghost beds. SPC’s average 258.6 ghost beds per facility which is the lowest among the three types of facilities that have ghost beds.\r\nThere are 29 IGSA’s that have ghost beds representing 58% of the facilities with Ghost Beds. There are 14,812 Ghost Beds in IGSA facilities making up 64.51% of all ICE Ghost Beds. With an average of 510.76 Ghost Beds per facility, IGSA’s have the highest mean Ghost Beds of any of the three types of facilities.\r\nThere are 15 CDF’s that have Ghost Beds representing 30% of the facilities that have Ghost Beds. There are a total of 6,894 Ghost Beds in CDF’s representing 30.03% of all ICE Ghost Beds. Having an average of 459.6 ghost bed per facility, CDF’s fall in between IGSA’s and SPC’s.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 6: Ghost beds by facility type.\r\n\r\n\r\nType Detailed\r\n\r\n\r\nn Facilities w.

The DHS budget request for FY21 provides information on 27 facilities with guaranteed minimums (DHS 2020, ICE-O&S-137), and among those facilities (n=27) the mean per diem is $123.04 (SD=43.02). Presumably, the Guaranteed Minimums at the remaining 23 facilities were established after the FY21 budget request. For the purpose of estimating the total cost of Guaranteed Minimums and unused Ghost Beds, for the 23 facilities for which Guaranteed Minimums are unlisted the average of the Guaranteed Minimums per diem rate for the 27 facilities listed in the FY21 budget request are used (DHS 2020, ICE-O&S-137).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on reported Guaranteed Minimum per diem rates, and average rates where not reported, the total daily cost of Guaranteed Minimum ICE detention beds is $4,308,391 and the total estimated cost of Ghost Beds is $2,952,525.\r\nFigure 11 shows the Guaranteed Minimum per diem rate by facility type. SPC’s tend to have higher Guaranteed Minimum per diem costs than either CDF’s or IGSA’s. One reason that a large number of IGSA’s guaranteed minimums hover around a per diem of 125 is that many of these facilities are not listed in the FY21 year to date figures and the values are based on averages. It would be good to determine which kinds of facilities have new Guaranteed Minimums. Figure 12 shows the average Guaranteed Minimum cost by facility type. On average, most facilities have roughly similar costs even though IGSA’s and CFS’s are larger. The leveling of average cost may be related to the higher per diems for SPC’s. Figure 13 shows the average Ghost Bed cost by facility type. SPC’s have slightly lower costs than IGSA’s and CDF’s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 11: Violin-sina plot of Guaranteed Minimum per diem rate by ICE detention Type Detailed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 12: Violin-sina plot of average Guaranteed Minimum Cost by ICE detention Type Detailed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 13: Violin-sina plot of Ghost Bed Cost by ICE detention Type Detailed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 Supplementary\r\n5.1 Session Information\r\n\r\nAnalyses were conducted using the R Statistical language (version 4.1.0; R Core Team, 2021) on Windows 10 x64 (build 19041)\r\n\r\n5.2 Packages\r\nThe following R packages were used used in preparing this document.\r\n\r\neffectsize (version 0.4.4.1; Ben-Shachar M et al., 2020)\r\nrio (version 0.5.26; Chung-hong Chan et al., 2021)\r\nsummarytools (version 0.9.9; Dominic Comtois, 2021)\r\nggplot2 (version 3.3.4; Wickham. ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis.

This time frame spans the beginnings of the contemporary period of immigration detention in 1980 (Arthur C. Helton 1984; Arthur C. Helton 1986a), the official policy of prevention through deterrence (U.S Border Patrol 1994; Nevins 2002; Dunn 2009), the rise of crimmigration (Stumpf 2006a), the post-911 transformation of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) from being under the Department of Justice (DOJ) to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (Bush 2002), and finally the COVID-19 pandemic (Hooks and Libal 2020; Ghandehari and Viera 2020). Particular attention is paid to the rapid rise in detention during the first years of Trump administration followed by the largest ever decline in immigration detention which occurred during the final year of the Trump administration.\r\n2 Brief History of the Current Immigration Detention System\r\nImmigration detention was invented in the United States at Ellis Island in 1891 (Wilsher 2011: 13). Many scholars have observed that this immigration station, as well as Angel Island which opened in 1910 (Barde and Bobonis 2006; Lai 1978; Daniels 1997), were sites where racist and eugenical immigration policy played out (Dolmage 2011). For example, immigration law at the time prohibited the entry of Chinese persons, individuals with mental illness, or those who did not conform to heteronormative standards (Dolmage 2011). In 1954 Ellis Island closed as an immigration inspection station and with it practice of detaining arriving individuals was (for a time) disbanded (“The Closing of Ellis Island” 1955; Simon 1998). However, it is important to note that the detention of non-citizens (and in some cases citizens) for immigration purposes via interior enforcement increased markedly that same year (Swing 1954: 31, 36; Lytle Hernández 2006: 50-51).\r\n2.1 Caribbean Refugees and the Modern Detention System\r\nToday, the US has the largest immigration detention system of any country and much of it is managed by private prison contractors. How did this modern system come into being? In the summer of 1980, on the heels of signing the landmark Refugee Act, the Carter administration once again began detaining arriving individuals–in this case Cubans and Haitians arriving to Miami by boat (Arthur C. Helton 1984; Arthur C. Helton 1986b; Lindskoog 2018). This initially ad hoc shift in policy ushered in the current period of immigration detention. Between May 20 and July 31, 1981, six months into the Reagan administration all Haitians arriving by boat to southern Florida without entry documents were detained at Camp Krome (Arthur C. Helton 1986b: 133), a repurposed cold war Nike missile base (Lipman 2013).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Cover from Lindskoog (2018)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis blanket change in detention policy was instigated without formal rule making and the INS was sued over the matter in the Southern District of Florida. District Judge Spellman cited precedent regarding inherent powers in international relations but ruled that the policy was implemented in a way that violated the Administrative Procedures Act and that 1800 Haitians should be released (Arthur C. Helton 1986b: 133) but Judge Spellman denied the claim that the policy was discriminatory. In July of 1982, in the Federal Register, the INS and DOJ published the new interim rule effective immediately, suspending the normal 30 day publication requirement (Immigration and Naturalization Service and Department of Justice 1982a). The INS argued that rule was exempt from normal procedures due to an “emergency situation which exists by virtue of a mass influx of illegal aliens” (Immigration and Naturalization Service and Department of Justice 1982a, 30045). The final rule was implemented shortly following (Immigration and Naturalization Service and Department of Justice 1982b), with little consideration of public comments that expressed substantive concerns over the new policy. Thus in 1981, contemporary immigration detention was hastily crafted under a “state of exception” (Agamben 2005) and similar emergency exceptions have been cited throughout this institutions history. For example, both the Migrant Protection Protocols and Title 42 expulsions, discussed below, were introduced in the context of emergency situations.\r\n3 Detention Over Time\r\n3.1 Annual ADP FY1979-2021\r\nThough the federal government does not supply comprehensive reporting of immigration detention ADP over time, it is possible to piece this information together from several sources (Takei, Tan, and Lin 2016: Figure 1; Siskin 2012: 13; DHS 2018) including the ICE Detention Management website (see Table 1 and Figure 2).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1: ADP FY1979-April FY 2021 to date.\r\n\r\n\r\nFY\r\n\r\n\r\nADP\r\n\r\n\r\n1979-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n2347\r\n\r\n\r\n1980-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n1595\r\n\r\n\r\n1981-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n2707\r\n\r\n\r\n1982-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n2899\r\n\r\n\r\n1983-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n2922\r\n\r\n\r\n1984-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n3428\r\n\r\n\r\n1985-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n4056\r\n\r\n\r\n1986-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n4006\r\n\r\n\r\n1987-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n3375\r\n\r\n\r\n1988-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n3931\r\n\r\n\r\n1989-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n6519\r\n\r\n\r\n1990-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n6663\r\n\r\n\r\n1991-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n6128\r\n\r\n\r\n1992-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n6006\r\n\r\n\r\n1993-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n\r\n1994-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n6785\r\n\r\n\r\n1995-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n7475\r\n\r\n\r\n1996-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n9011\r\n\r\n\r\n1997-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n11871\r\n\r\n\r\n1998-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n15447\r\n\r\n\r\n1999-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n17772\r\n\r\n\r\n2000-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n19458\r\n\r\n\r\n2001-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n20429\r\n\r\n\r\n2002-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n20282\r\n\r\n\r\n2003-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n21133\r\n\r\n\r\n2004-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n21298\r\n\r\n\r\n2005-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n19619\r\n\r\n\r\n2006-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n19409\r\n\r\n\r\n2007-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n27883\r\n\r\n\r\n2008-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n31771\r\n\r\n\r\n2009-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n32098\r\n\r\n\r\n2010-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n30885\r\n\r\n\r\n2011-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n33330\r\n\r\n\r\n2012-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n34260\r\n\r\n\r\n2013-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n33788\r\n\r\n\r\n2014-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n33227\r\n\r\n\r\n2015-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n28449\r\n\r\n\r\n2016-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n34376\r\n\r\n\r\n2017-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n38106\r\n\r\n\r\n2018-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n42188\r\n\r\n\r\n2019-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n50165\r\n\r\n\r\n2020-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n33724\r\n\r\n\r\n2021-01-01\r\n\r\n\r\n15821\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlotting immigration detention ADP over time shows that since its inception, ADP generally increased up until the middle of the Trump administration, after the onset of the COVID-19. In fact, with the exception of G.W.H. Bush, from inauguration date to leaving office, every administration except for Trump appears to have experienced an increase in ADP (see Table 2). The greatest increase in ADP came during the Clinton administration and as mentioned, the greatest decline in ADP was during the Trump administration. Some reasons for the decline in detention population during the Trump administration, namely MPP and Title 42 expulsions, will be discussed below. First, a few thoughts on the large increase during the Clinton administration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 2: Changes in ADP by Administration. Note it is difficult to calculate for G.H.W Bush because data are missing for 1993.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal Change\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Change\r\n\r\n\r\nReagan\r\n\r\n\r\n3812\r\n\r\n\r\n477\r\n\r\n\r\nG.H.W.

Bush\r\n\r\n\r\n11669\r\n\r\n\r\n1459\r\n\r\n\r\nObama\r\n\r\n\r\n6008\r\n\r\n\r\n751\r\n\r\n\r\nTrump\r\n\r\n\r\n-22294\r\n\r\n\r\n-5574\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the Clinton administration, the policy of “prevention through deterrence” in 1994 (U.S Border Patrol 1994) was officially established and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996 was signed. In 1994, prevention through deterrence involved the initiation of the construction of the southern border wall as we know it, first in San Diego and later in El Paso. IIRIRA expanded the definition of aggregated felon for which immigration detention was mandatory and solidified the new blending of criminal and immigration law that has come to be known as crimmigration (Stumpf 2006b; Ackerman, Sacks, and Furman 2014). While there were no sharp peaks or valleys in ADP during the Clinton administration, by gradual process, Clinton’s administration marks the largest growth per time in ADP of any administration since contemporary immigration detention was established.\r\nDespite an overall trend of increasing ADP over time, there are brief declines in ADP during the middle of the W. Bush and the latter part of the Obama administrations (see Figure 2). Yet, notably, each these brief declines is followed by a sharp increase. Other events and policies surrounding these declines followed by sharp inclines warrant further consideration. Specifically, the period from FY2005-2007 and from FY2014-2016 are of particular interest. However, if the trends following these past two declines, during the W. Bush and Obama administrations, hold true then one might hypothesize a sharp increase in ADP during the Biden administration or the succeeding administration.\r\nThe largest decline in immigration detention ADP modern history occurred in FY2021 during the Trump administration. Interestingly, this sharp decline follows on the largest spike in ADP, which started in FY2016 during the final year of the Obama administration and continued through the first three years of the Trump administration up to FY2019. Several factors likely played a significant role in the dramatic drop in ADP that occurred between FY2019-2020. On January 24, 2019 Secretary of Homeland Security announced the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), more widely known as the “remain in Mexico policy.” Looking at yearly summaries (see Figure 2), this policy does not seem to have resulted in an immediate drop in ADP. However, it is possible that MPP had a contributing effect to lowering ADP (see Section ??. The Biden administration ended MPP, however, for reasons described below the lifting of this policy has not had a major impact on individuals who were subjected to it (see following paragraph).\r\nBy March, 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic was more widespread in the US. On March 13, 2020 ICE suspended visitation to immigration detention centers. On March 20, 2020 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an order suspending the right to introduce certain persons into the US from countries were a quarantinable communicable disease exists. This rule is more generally known as the Title 42 expulsion. This rule, which prohibits entry on health grounds, likely had a significant role to play in lowering ADP. The Biden administration has largely continued with the Title 42 policy. Maintaining Title 42 restrictions in place has meant that despite the lifting of MPP, many migrants have been forced to remain in Mexico. They are thus not entering the US and being held in immigration detention. One might hypothesize that a greater than normal portion of people held in immigration detention during FY2020 entered the system through interior enforcement rather than as arriving individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{\"x\":{\"data\":[{\"x\":[3287,3652,4018,4383,4748,5113,5479,5844,6209,6574,6940,7305,7670,8035,8401,8766,9131,9496,9862,10227,10592,10957,11323,11688,12053,12418,12784,13149,13514,13879,14245,14610,14975,15340,15706,16071,16436,16801,17167,17532,17897,18262,18628],\"y\":[2347,1595,2707,2899,2922,3428,4056,4006,3375,3931,6519,6663,6128,6006,null,6785,7475,9011,11871,15447,17772,19458,20429,20282,21133,21298,19619,19409,27883,31771,32098,30885,33330,34260,33788,33227,28449,34376,38106,42188,50165,33724,15821],\"text\":[\"FY:

In fact, ADP was falling two months prior to the announcement of MPP. August 2019 is the key inflection point when ADP begins to drop and continue falling steadily through the remainder of the Trump administration.\r\nWhile it might initially be tempting to suggest that MPP had little impact on ADP, it is possible that it took several months for the full effects of MPP on ADP to manifest. Given that during this same time period, the average length of stay (ALOS) in ICE detention was around 35 days that it may have taken several months for MPP’s effects on ADP to manifest. It would be useful to examine changes in ALOS over this time period.\r\nThough ADP was dropping before the announcement of Title 42 expulsions, the change in ADP that same month is one of the largest drops in the monthly data. Following Title 42 expulsions, ADP continues to fall until after Biden is inaugurated. Notably, consistent with the overall trend, ICE detention ADP has risen every complete month since Biden’s inauguration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: ADP by Month October 2018-April 2021\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.3 Daily Detention Numbers During COVID-19 Pandemic\r\nOn March 27, 2020 ICE established the Guidance on COVID-19 web page and indicated the site would be updated frequently. Shortly afterwards Craig began logging the data on a daily basis, occasionally relying on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine’s regular scrapes of the page to pick up days that were missed.\r\nThe Guidance on COVID-19 web page began first with reporting the number of detained individuals who were COVID-19 positive.

the time span of the data reported are very limited and don’t permit tracking through changes resulting from Title 42 expulsions. However, one trend visible is that ADP was falling during the final months of the Trump administration and began to climb again at the outset of the Biden administration.\r\nOn January 26, 2021 through an Executive Order, Biden ended the use of private prisons for Bureau of Prison (BOP) facilities. On the campaign trail, Biden pledged to end private immigration detention (Biden 2020). However, Biden has not taken any visible steps to end private immigration detention and the DHS is presently paying for a large number of “ghost beds” (Selman and Leighton 2010: 114) which may be a sign that the administration is considering placing large numbers of individuals in immigration detention in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Daily Detention Totals April 25, 2020-April 23, 2021\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAckerman, Alissa R, Meghan Sacks, and Rich Furman. 2014. “The New Penology Revisited: The Criminalization of Immigration as a Pacification Strategy,” 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgamben, Giorgio. 2005.
