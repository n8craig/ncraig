I am an anthropologist interested in power, domination, and resistance. I spent a good portion of my life doing archaeology and ethnoarchaeology focusing on South America. Recently, I turned my attention to incarceration and immigration. Using computers and digital data is part of my practice as a scholar activist. A good bit of what I blog about on this site involves writing about using reproducible research methods.
